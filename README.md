# Jupyter Server Proxy for Panel

When jupyter-panel-server is installed and you run `jupyter notebook`,
you'll find the served version of the panel app at the regular url
such as `http://localhost:8888` followed by `panel_server/<name_of_repo>`

Name notebooks main.ipynb to make them discoverable for jupyter-panel-server.
